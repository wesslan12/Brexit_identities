# Brexit Identities 
I investigated the relationship between party vote choice in the 2015 UK parliamentary election and public opinions on the economic impact of immigration. This study is framed within the context of the prevailing political landscape, notably the emergence of Brexit identities that Sara Hobolt highlighted in her work "Emerging Brexit Identities" (2018). Hobolt's analysis reveals a strong emotional attachment among voters to being either a 'Remainer' or a 'Leaver,' overshadowing traditional party loyalties. This shift suggests that party vote choice may reflect attitudes towards the Brexit dichotomy more than allegiance to any political party.

Given the centrality of immigration to both the 2015 general election and the broader Brexit debate, my hypothesis posited that negative views on immigration's economic impact would correlate with support for "Leave"-aligned parties (notably the Conservative and UKIP parties), while positive views would align with "Remain"-supportive parties (Labour and Liberal Democrats). To test this hypothesis, I utilized data from the European Social Survey (ESS) round conducted in the UK in 2016, focusing on attitudes towards immigration, party vote choice, and control variables such as age, gender, and educational attainment.

The analysis employed multinomial logistic regression models. Initial results showed a significant relationship between immigration attitudes and party choice, confirming our hypotheses. For example, a more positive view on immigration increased the odds of voting for the Liberal Democrats relative to Labour, while a more negative view increased the likelihood of voting for Conservative or UKIP parties. Further analysis with control variables for age, sex, and education indicated that these demographic factors also influenced party vote choice but did not diminish the effect of immigration attitudes. The likelihood ratio test supported the inclusion of these controls, suggesting distinct demographic effects on party preference.

Predictive probability analysis revealed that positive immigration attitudes were associated with a higher probability of voting Labour across education levels, while negative views corresponded with higher probabilities of voting for UKIP or the Conservative party. The influence of education was particularly notable, with higher education correlating with a higher likelihood of voting for more liberal parties, consistent with the expected liberal bias among younger, city-dwelling, educated demographics.

In conclusion, the thesis provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that views on the economic impact of immigration significantly influence UK party vote choice, aligning with the broader political divide over Brexit. While further analysis is needed to explore the intricate relationship between political identities and voting behavior, initial findings underscore the profound impact of Brexit identities on the UK's political landscape.
